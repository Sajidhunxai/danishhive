# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Clear Browser Storage

The Supabase client was trying to auto-refresh old tokens.
This has been disabled, but you MUST clear browser storage:

## In Browser Console (F12):
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();

## Or manually:
1. F12 → Application → Local Storage → Clear
2. Session Storage → Clear  
3. Reload (F5)

This removes old Supabase tokens completely.
